React
-React is a frontend library of js 


Angular	React
-framework – developers nu full control undavilla	-library – developers nu all access
-real DOM - (in real DOM if an component change then the entire component will recompile)	-virtual DOM - (in real DOM if an component change then that component only recompile)
-building blocks 
Html, css, typescript	-building blocks
Html, css, javascript


Advantages
-virtual dom (faster and storage space)
-reusable components 
-concept of jsx (javascript Xml)- mixed of html and js – we use html and js in one page

Installation command 
Global installation
-------------------------------------------
npm i -g Create-react-app projectName
local installation
-------------------------------------
Npx- node module page ne execulte cheyyan pattum  npx  Create-react-app projectName
npm start



In App.js there must be 1 parent element 
import React from 'react'

function New() {
    //js code 
  return (
    <>
    <h1>New component</h1>
    <h1>New component</h1>
    </>
  )
}

export default New

rfce – import a function component short cut
--------
r-react 
f-function 
c- component 
e-export 

data sharing
parent component – child component 

variable-state








Managing state in react (for functional component) we use hooks
1)	useState – react library
2)	

props(data sharing in react)
technique used to share data from parent component to child component 

we use state and variable for store data 
direct value kodukkuvanel nammakkk variable use cheyyam . but valua pinned anu varunnath engil state use cheyyam. Like asynchronous call api 


Redirection In react
-----------------------

react-router-dom  - library used for redirection 

component used for routing 
----------------------
BrowserRouter - root component selector
Route - for path setting
Routes - if we use more than one path 


params
------

-useParams - hook used to access params


REDUX
-----
props drilling - data will stuck in any intermediate component when the component have any issues 
- props drilling occurs during 

coupling - many connection between parent and child 

to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all components independent

so react introduced a state management technology - redux 


a js store file 

redux 
react-redux 
redux-thunk


in redux we use api calls . but redux is synchronous we need to change
 it to asynchronous . so we use middleware to change redux to asynchronous 

thunk is used for middlwware creation

store apply cheyyan provider use cheyyunnu 

axios 
------
used to call api in react 

useSelector - hook used to access data from store
